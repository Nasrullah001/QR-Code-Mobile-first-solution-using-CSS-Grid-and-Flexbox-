## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt a lot attempting this challenge, the likes of the:
- border-radius property
- box-shadow property
- display property amongst others. 
Although, it seems cumbersome for me at start as a beginner; but I later got a way out of its trenches.


### Useful resources

- [Web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html/) - This helped me learn the basics of HTML. I'll recommend it for a beginner on the street of HTML.
- [Web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the rudiments and the real concept of CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
